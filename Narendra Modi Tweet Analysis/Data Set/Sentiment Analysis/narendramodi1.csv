"During his long years in public life, George Sahab never deviated from his political ideology. He resisted the Emergency tooth and nail. His simplicity and humility were noteworthy. My thoughts are with his family, friends and lakhs of people grieving. May his soul rest in peace."
"When we think of Mr. George Fernandes, we remember most notably the fiery trade union leader who fought for justice, the leader who could humble the mightiest of politicians at the hustings, a visionary Railway Minister and a great Defence Minister who made India safe and strong."
"George Sahab represented the best of Indiaâ€™s political leadership.   Frank and fearless, forthright and farsighted, he made a valuable contribution to our country. He was among the most effective voices for the rights of the poor and marginalised.   Saddened by his passing away."

A Karyakarta from Kollam asked me about what the BJP Karyakartas can do to further the Partyâ€™s reach across Kerala and other parts. Here is what I said. pic.twitter.com/kfspPrd8Yr
Kerala has seen Congress and Communist rule. Both are efficient in corruption and inefficient in governance.   BJP is different from the two and promises a people-friendly and non-corrupt government in Kerala. pic.twitter.com/IK5NzRrzB4
I specially salute the hardworking @BJP4Keralam Karyakartas. They are assiduously serving the people and raising issues of public importance. This when successive Governments in Kerala have shown little respect for democracy and stood silent when our Karyakartas were killed. pic.twitter.com/tL1mxlSgUk

India remembers the Emergency as a dark period during which every institution was subverted and an atmosphere of fear was created. Not only people but also ideas and artistic freedom were held hostage to power politics.
"I salute the courage of all those great women and men who steadfastly resisted the Emergency, which was imposed 43 years ago. Their struggles ensured people power prevailed over authoritarianism and the stifling of civil liberties."

"When Karnataka was suffering from a drought, Congress ministers who should have helped our farmers were in Delhi playing divisive politics. pic.twitter.com/fnxxDRPecN"
"We are working towards fulfilling the vision of Bhagwan Basaveshwara.   Unfortunately, the Congress has no understanding of his thoughts and ideals. pic.twitter.com/KYXmWpqsgf"
"If the Congress was sincere about the empowerment of women, they should have allowed Parliament to function. They did not allow the passage of the bill abolishing Triple Talaq. Congress' injustice towards Muslim women has not gone down well among the Muslim community."
"A @BJP4Karnataka Government is going to focus on food processing and horticulture. The current Congress government in the state has not devoted attention towards agriculture and irrigation. Under @BSYBJP Ji, we will give topmost priority to farmer welfare. pic.twitter.com/orMazRTGKo"

"The aim of Ayushman Bharat is to provide maximum benefit to the poor and marginalised, and work towards a healthy India. This programme will bring a positive difference in the lives of 50 crore Indians."
Chaired a high-level meeting to review the progress on the Health Assurance programme under Ayushman Bharat. Reviewed the preparations including consultation with states for a smooth rollout of the programme. http://nm-4.com/75c6Â 
The Central Governmentâ€™s emphasis on the personal sector and the unprecedented creation of next-generation infrastructure is going to benefit our youngsters the most. We are committed to facilitating the right environment for our youth to prosper.
Spoke about the importance of Indiaâ€™s demographic dividend and highlighted how efforts like the Atal Innovation Mission are furthering a spirit of research as well as scientific temper among young minds.
"My young Karyakarta friends are anguished by the culture of political violence, that is integral to some parties opposed to us. In Karnataka itself, young BJP Karyakartas lost their lives while the state government did nothing. There is no place for such politics in our nation!"
"I am often fascinated by the manner in which todayâ€™s youth acquaints itself with latest technology. Sadly, the Congress is opposed to all forms of technological innovations. Such a party can never be the voice for the youth of 21st century India."
Todayâ€™s youngsters see @BJP4India with great affinity. Ours is a party where the aspirations of the New India youth find voice. Youngsters are also benefitting from initiatives such as Digital India and Mudra Yojana.
Interacting with the @BJP4Karnataka Yuva Morcha made me extremely happy. The enthusiasm of our youngsters gives me great hope for the future of our nation. Sharing todayâ€™s highlights. http://nm-4.com/r2c6Â

"The Central Government has taken unprecedented steps for the Textiles and handloom sectors. The Mudra Yojana is doing wonders for our hardworking weavers.   In contrast, the Congress Government in Karnataka has not shown any effort to change the lives of our weavers."
"Instead of giving a proper account of the work done by the Karnataka government in the last five years, Congress is busy hurling abuses at me. Congress must also explain to the nation why they did not let Parliament function and why they prevented the formation of OBC commission."
Addressed a massive rally in Hubballi. Here is my speech.Â  http://nm-4.com/c0c6Â  pic.twitter.com/LURrn07zHG

The mood in Bagalkot district is distinctly in favour of the @BJP4Karnataka and this is terrible news for the topmost Congress leaders of Karnataka. People see BJP as the party that can fulfil aspirations of the youth.

"In Mangaluru, I saw the affection of people from all sections of society towards BJP. Citizens want a Swachh, Sundar and Surakshit Karnataka, which only @BJP4Karnataka can provide."
"Sharing my speech at the huge Mangaluru rally. The @BJP4Karnatakaâ€™s development agenda is prevailing over the politics of nepotism and corruption of the Congress.

Today once again I have the opportunity of connecting with my sisters and brothers of Karnataka. Would be addressing four rallies across the state. @BJP4Karnataka https://twitter.com/bjp4india/status/992485496218636288Â â€¦
"Birthday greetings to Haryanaâ€™s Chief Minister, Shri @mlkhattar Ji. I pray for his long and healthy life."
It is gladdening to note that substantial number of beneficiaries of the Central Governmentâ€™s social sector schemes are women. Mudra Yojana is furthering a spirit of self-reliance among women.
The previous BJP Government in Karnataka undertook several initiatives for the welfare of women. @BJP4Karnataka will continue to serve Karnatakaâ€™s Nari Shakti with the same diligence and work towards empowering lives.
"During the interaction with @BJP4Karnataka Mahila Morcha Karyakartas, elaborated on the steps of the Central Government towards women-led development and highlighted how movements like â€˜Beti Bachao, Beti Padhaoâ€™ and Ujjwala Yojana have transformed lives of several women."
"Continuing the series of interactions via the NaMo App, had a wonderful interaction with @BJP4Karnataka Mahila Morcha Karyakartas. Here are the highlights. http://nm-4.com/tqc6Â "
Thank you Karnataka. Overwhelmed by the support today! pic.twitter.com/azlG0aBx9m

"BJP is committed towards creating a Swachh, Sundar and Surakshit Karnataka.  http://nm-4.com/vnc6Â  pic.twitter.com/Y4wxOp7P0e"
"Congressâ€™ dislike for the Indian Army and the valour of our soldiers is not new. Congress treated Field Marshal Cariappa and later, General Thimayya very poorly. Such insult and disrespect is what the Congress culture is about."
"Congress can win Gold Medals in corruption, telling lies and making false promises. pic.twitter.com/3djcEaWtur"
"Congress attempted to change Bengaluru, a city of beauty, learning and cosmopolitan character into a centre of urban decay, crime and chaos. Bengaluru is never going to forgive Congress. pic.twitter.com/m2i3PKwZ0h"
Joined the huge public meeting in Bengaluru. I could sense the peopleâ€™s anguish due to the poor governance of the Congress in state.

"After massive rallies in Kalaburagi and Ballari, I am heading to Bengaluru. Everybody knows how Congress has promoted corrupt and lumpen elements in Bengaluru and ignored the cityâ€™s infrastructure needs. @BJP4Karnataka will serve Bengaluru with utmost diligence and dedication."
Thank you Ballari for the phenomenal support. Here are some pictures and the highlights of my speech.  http://nm-4.com/vnc6Â  pic.twitter.com/i8O01yMJ0H

"For the last five years, the Karnataka Government is asleep and because of their inertia the state is suffering. Farmers are in distress, Textile, MSME sectors are not getting support and there is rampant corruption. No wonder people are so keen to reject Congress. @BJP4Karnataka"

"Continuing my interactions via the NaMo App, I will talk to the @BJP4Karnataka Mahila Morcha members at 9 AM on 4th May 2018. Looking forward."
The Congress Government in Karnataka has completely ignored the stateâ€™s agriculture sector. They have been insensitive towards the aspirations of the farmers. The farmers of Karnataka deserve better.
This yearâ€™s Union Budget had several farmer-friendly measures that would facilitate value addition and strengthen the supply chain. These steps are in line with our commitment to double farmer incomes by 2022.
Appealed to my farmer sisters and brothers to embrace latest technology and best practises in agriculture. Also urged farmers to take-up micro-irrigation.
Talked at length about the Fasal Bima Yojana & the Governmentâ€™s â€˜Beej Se Bazar Takâ€™ formula which is instrumental in bringing a positive change in the lives of our hardworking farmers. @BJP4Karnataka
Fruitful interaction with the @BJP4Karnataka Kisan Morcha this morning via the NaMo App. Spoke at length about the NDA Governmentâ€™s measures towards invigorating the agriculture sector. http://nm-4.com/8fc6Â

"Karnataka Congress has a â€˜2+1 formula.â€™ Fearing defeat, the CM is contesting two seats and has vacated his seat to promote dynasty politics.

The victory of @BJP4Tripura is not an ordinary electoral victory. This journey from â€˜Shunyaâ€™ to â€˜Shikharâ€™ has been made possible due to a solid development agenda and the strength of our organisation. I bow to every BJP Karyakarta for working assiduously on the ground for years.
2018 Tripura election will be remembered as an epoch-making one! What my sisters and brothers of Tripura have done is extraordinary. No words will be enough to thank them for the phenomenal support towards @BJP4Tripura. We will leave no stone unturned in transforming Tripura.
"People of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura have spoken!   I thank the people of these states for supporting the good governance agenda and â€˜Act East Policyâ€™ of @BJP4India & our valued allies. We remain committed to working towards fulfilling the dreams & aspirations of the people."

The entire nation stands with the people of Northeast during this time. Centre assures all possible help to normalise the situation.
I am anguished by the situation arising due to floods in various parts of the Northeast. I share the pain of all those affected by floods.
I have spoken to the Governor and Chief Minister of J&K and assured all possible assistance required.
India will never get bogged down by such cowardly attacks & the evil designs of hate.
My thoughts are with all those who lost their loved ones in the attack in J&K. My prayers with the injured.
Pained beyond words on the dastardly attack on peaceful Amarnath Yatris in J&K. The attack deserves strongest condemnation from everyone.
"I remember an insightful discussion with Naresh Ji, who as USA ambassador invited me for dinner. He believed in strong India-USA friendship."

The foundation stone of Bharuch Bus Port will also be laid tomorrow. These projects will have immense benefits for the people of Gujarat.
I will visit the plant of ONGC Petro Additions Limited (OPAL) at Dahej & also interact with industry leaders.
Will dedicate to the nation a Four-Lane Extradosed Bridge over the Narmada at Bharuch on NH-8 and Petrochemicals Complex of OPAL at Dahej.
"My 2-day Gujarat visit starting tomorrow includes various programmes in Dahej, Bharuch, Somnath and Gandhinagar."

"Yes, Centre will be left with lesser funds but we want to strengthen hands of States in pursuing their development agenda as per their needs"
"Total devolution to the States in 2015-2016 is higher than in previous years, giving more power to States for their progress journey."

"Am told this conference brings together several delegates from Central & State Govts, Armed Forces, Academia, Industry & private sector."
"I thought- despite not attending, how can I connect with you. That is when I decided to use technology & talk to you via this medium."
"I wanted to personally attend the conference but was unable to do so. However, there was no way I could miss interacting with you."
Good morning friends! I am delighted to join the 18th National Conference on e-Governance through Twitter.

Wished President Pranab Mukherjee a very Happy Diwali from Siachen! Am sure this would be among the most unique greetings Pranab Da received
Perhaps this is the 1st time that a PM has got the wonderful opportunity of spending time with our Jawans on this auspicious day of Diwali.
"From the icy heights of the Siachen Glacier & with the brave Jawans & Officers of the Armed Forces, I wish all of you a Happy Diwali."
After the Siachen visit I will continue with my scheduled visit to Srinagar to spend time with those affected due to the recent floods.
Am going to Siachen with a message from each and every Indian to our soldiers- that we stand shoulder to shoulder with you!
"Be it the altitude or bitter cold, nothing deters our soldiers. They stand there, serving our Nation. They make us truly proud."
"Everyone is aware of the extreme conditions at Siachen. Overcoming every challenge our soldiers stand firm, protecting our Motherland."
"Friends, I am leaving for Siachen Glacier. Its my good fortune that I will be able to spend time with our brave soldiers on this special day"
Wishing all of you a very Happy Diwali. May our lives be illuminated with joy & peace. May the lamp of prosperity be lit among the poor.

Stable mandates can do wonders. A full majority for BJP will ensure record development of Maharashtra!  http://nm4.in/1xS3ZkLÂ 
BJP wants to work for the farmers & villages of Maharashtra. At the same time we want industries & jobs to come to the State.
"Cong-NCP ruled Maharashtra for 15 years & were in Delhi for 10 years. Yet, so many farmers of Maharashtra committed suicide every year. Why?"
Maharashtra can't be looted any further. For 15 years Congress-NCP enriched their own pockets & were least bothered about the people.
"Amazing atmosphere at the rallies in Sangli, Kolhapur & Gondia! Maharashtra is all set to punish Congress & NCP for their misgovernance."
Rashtrapati ji's support adds immense strength to Swachh Bharat Mission. We have to work hard & work towards a Clean India. #MyCleanIndia

This Election is for Maharashtra's future. An entire generation got ruined due to misgovernance of the last 15 years. Time to change that.
People of Maharashtra gave political stability for 15 yrs but what did they get?Their dreams lie shattered. Corruption & Dadagiri is rampant

Today once again India has won! The power of the ballot has won & spirit of democracy has emerged supreme. My Blog http://nm4.in/1nzxTVUÂ 
"Due to social media, lies & false promises of several leaders could not go beyond the podiums of their rallies! More power to social media."
Wherever I went it was a delight to interact with local people. Social media also helped me understand their sentiments.
NDA remained firmly focussed on the agenda of development & good governance & ensured this became focal points of the entire campaign.
"Usually ruling Party sets agenda of the election but in this campaign ruling party was neither proactive nor responsive,it remained reactive"
The biggest joy of 2014 Elections has been the increased turnout. Braving the scorching heat & the rain people turned out in large numbers.
I congratulate the EC & the entire election & security staff for their continuous efforts during the entire Election.
India has voted! Congratulations to the people of India on the successful completion of 2014 Lok Sabha elections  http://nm4.in/1nzxTVUÂ

This is curtain raiser for 16th May. Both states will give massive mandate for the TDP-BJP alliance in Parliament & Assembly elections @ncbn
Congratulations to the people of Seemandhra & Telangana for giving favourable results today in municipal elections for the TDP & BJP.
All those voting in today's phase- Have you voted? If not please go to the polling booth! Sharing my video message http://nm4.in/RFmXc4Â 
Met Chhattisgarh CM @drramansingh in Gandhinagar pic.twitter.com/XBdCiOpglS
My special request to the youth - go out & vote and take your family and friends along to the polling booth!
Today is final phase of 2014 Polls. Urging all those voting in 41 seats across 3 states & Assembly by-polls in WB to vote in large numbers.
The legal fraternity has lost a strong pillar in Shri Tarakant Jha. He will also be remembered for his passion towards Maithili language.
In Shri Tarakant Jha we lost a dedicated leader who played an instrumental role in building the BJP. May his soul rest in peace.
Also sharing my speech at International Conference on Defence Offsets during last year's Vibrant Gujarat Summit http://nm4.in/WS4rIvÂ 
Our Scientists are our strength and will help shape our future in this Knowledge Era with both Defence and Civilian Impact.
"Today, we should think on how India can become self-sufficient in defence manufacturing. How can we strengthen R&D in defence sector."
NDA's foreign policy also ensured that those nations opposed to India testing gradually developed strong ties with India in various fields.
Tests of 1998 were a victory of technology & the nation's willpower. Our scientists worked very hard to develop Nuclear Programme.
Sharing my last year's Blog that contains portions of Atal ji's historic speech of 1998 http://nm4.in/YADSN0Â 
"Under Atal ji, India scripted a new chapter in our history & gave a strong message to the world with the success of the Tests in Pokhran."
"My greetings to the nation & the scientist community on National Technology Day, marking the anniversary of the Pokhran Tests of 1998."
There is something in India's soil that makes India special. Our destined role of Jagat Guru calls. Lets create a strong & developed India!
I am overwhelmed by people's response! I assure them we will repay their affection with unprecedented development.
"8 months, 5800+ rallies, Charchas, programmes, 3 lakh+ KMsâ€¦an extensive, innovative & satisfying journey. My blog http://nm4.in/1nslV0sÂ "
After addressing final campaign rally came to seek Atal ji's blessings. Had met him when campaign started. Its always special to meet him.
Give BJP all seats from UP & give us the opportunity to take UP & India's development journey to newer heights http://nm4.in/1jcKhDzÂ 
UP has won me over! I have received tremendous affection from people of UP during the entire campaign. My gratitude to the people of UP.

Today I was in UP & Bihar and one has to be there at the rallies to believe the enthusiasm. People are looking to NDA as a ray of hope.
There are people sitting in AC rooms who say we are fatigued due to duration of polls but mood on the ground suggests otherwise.
"Despite Congress efforts to bring caste & communal politics in campaign, we remained focussed on our agenda of development & good governance"
From Day 1 Congress' attitude to Elections has been non-serious. They talked about everything apart from core issues & what they did in Govt
I thank everyone who has tirelessly worked for the success of the 3D rallies! These rallies would not be possible without their efforts.
Today was the final round of the Bharat Vijay 3D rallies. In all the rounds I addressed people from over 1300 locations across India.
Today will address the final round of Bharat Vijay 3D rallies. Don't miss this once in a lifetime experience  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/Â â€¦
"In Siwan I asked people if they want those days to return when criminals were given a free hand, they answered NO!  http://www.india272.com/2014/05/09/siwan/Â â€¦"
Kerala Minister who came to meet me was reprimanded. Cong leader wanted Lata ji's Bharat Ratna taken back.This is politics of untouchability
If someone does politics of untouchability it is the Congress & those who made their political careers by following votebank politics.
"As a Party President, using terms like ""Unch"" & ""Neech"" does not suit Madam. Is the fear of defeat so much that she has to say such things?"
"Mirzapur's brass, carpet & handloom industry face many problems & brick kilns are not running. What have UP Govt. & Centre done about it?"
Addressed rallies in UP & Bihar. Here is a picture from Mirzapur rally  http://www.india272.com/2014/05/09/mirzapur/Â â€¦ pic.twitter.com/EShpkDXjGD
Before the Rohaniya rally I addressed 3 rallies in UP. Here are the highlights http://nm4.in/1fYP8xLÂ 
A video was shared in Rohaniya on how Sabarmati's glory is restored. We are committed to do the same with Ganga http://nm4.in/1ob9upUÂ 
"From tourism to giving better opportunities to Varanasi's weavers, there is lots to be done & am sure with our efforts we will succeed."
For me Varanasi election is not only about electing a new MP. I am here to bring a qualitative difference in lives of Varanasi's citizens.
Paid tributes to Shri Sone Lal Patel...have fond memories of interacting with him. Am sure he would be proud of Statue of Unity initiative.
At the Rohaniya rally Col. Nizamuddin joined us. He is over 100 years old & devoted his life to the nation by joining the Azad Hind Fauj.
I salute the hardwork & determination of our Karyakartas of Varanasi who are selflessly devoted to giving BJP a record win from Varanasi.
I am deeply grateful to people of Varanasi for their affection pic.twitter.com/aE5oOcOHCO

My profound apologies to Ganga Maa for not being able to perform Aarti today. Wish these people know that a Mother's love is above politics.
I appeal to my Karyakarta sisters & brothers to maintain peace & ensure that people do not face any difficulty.
It is unfortunate that EC is not concerned about the institution's neutrality & that is why our Karyakartas have to embark on a Satyagraha.
Here are highlights of my campaign in Bihar today. It is clear Bihar is going to vote for development & stability http://nm4.in/1qdzyT7Â 
"People of Bengal should bless NDA, which is fully committed towards well-being of West Bengal & its youth http://nm4.in/QdYbyfÂ "
Didi wanted Bangladeshi infiltrators removed in 2005. Now due to votebank politics she supports them. People didn't expect such Poriborton!
"We admired Didi for the way she fought the Left. People of Bengal expected Poriborton but nothing has changed in last 3 yrs, only Didi has."
"Addressed rallies in Kolkata, Barasat & Krishnanagar. I have received phenomenal affection from people of Bengal during the entire campaign."
"I also call upon those voting in Assembly polls in AP & those voting in Assembly by-polls in Bihar, HP, UP & WB to vote in record numbers."
Polling for 64 seats across 7 states is underway. I hope people will vote in large numbers & youngsters will show the way in doing so.
"NDA is firmly committed to creating a Skilled India, breaking away from the Scam India under UPA's misrule  http://www.india272.com/2014/05/06/3d-11/Â â€¦"
"Its a pity some minds can't see beyond balloons & toffees. Today, their own Govt. has given what they call ""toffee"" yet another trophy!"
The report also notes simplicity of the process & the fact that its done with minimum Govt. interference & it ensures good return to farmers
The Report lauds Guj's land Acquisition & Allocation model as a best practice that can be emulated by other states http://nm4.in/1huMoTHÂ 
I wish my friends in the Congress who keep abusing Gujarat would have read their own Govt's report that has lauded Gujarat's development.
Campaign for 2014 Elections is reaching its final stages but no Congress leader has talked about development issues. Very sad.
Connected with people voting in final phase during today's 3D rallies. My thanks to people from over 100 locations who joined the rallies.
Will address a round of 3D rallies. Join  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/?lang=EnglishÂ â€¦

My best wishes to pilgrims from all over India as the Badrinath Temple opens today.
A vote for @smritiirani is a vote for progress. She will do for Amethi in 60 months what they never did all these yrs http://nm4.in/1iUl5BzÂ 
They looted the nation in the name of the poor but now it is the son of a poor man who is challenging them. They are not able to digest that
A leader talking about women empowerment has failed to build facilities to educate girls in his own constituency! What can be more ironical.
Congress leaders can talk about everything from Modi to the Gujarat model but have they spoken a word on what they have done for Amethi?
I went to Amethi with a message of change. For years 1 family has ruined Amethi. I went to sow seeds of a better future for Amethi.
Thank you Amethi. Send a Lotus to Delhi from Amethi & make @smritiirani victorious by a record margin!  http://www.india272.com/2014/05/05/amethi/Â â€¦
Amethi elected 3 members of 1 family over the years but what did it get? This BJP Charge Sheet tells you just that  http://www.bjp.org/en/media-resources/press-releases/charge-sheet-on-amethi-m-p-sh-rahul-gandhiÂ â€¦
"After addressing rallies across UP, will address a rally in Amethi in support of @smritiirani. Looking forward to the rally."
'Amethi's untold story' -a video released at BJP Press Conference...every Indian should watch before voting http://nm4.in/1g27fNKÂ 
Election process has been long but people's excitement is only increasing. Direction of wind is very clear  http://www.india272.com/2014/05/04/3d-9/Â â€¦
"Over 6 lakh weavers lost their jobs. A package of Rs. 6,000 cr was announced but nothing reached the weavers. Its deeply distressing."
Places where I addressed 3D rallies have significant number of weavers. Its appalling how UPA has ignored the wellbeing of the weavers.
Began speech by expressing condolences to families of those who lost their lives in train accident in Maharashtra. Prayers with the injured.
People from over 100 locations where polling is expected to take place in the remaining 2 phases joined the 3D rallies today.
I am very happy that the doors of the holy Kedarnath Temple have once again opened for pilgrims. My best wishes to the pilgrims!
Will now address the Bharat Vijay 3D rallies. Looking forward to connecting with people from all over the country  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/Â â€¦

A short video capturing the enthusiasm at Allahabad rally https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38Sel2xwI8k&feature=youtu.beÂ â€¦
SP & BSP ruled UP for years. Congress is in power in Delhi but none of these parties presented their work record to the people. Shameful.
"Instead of improving people's lives in UP, Cong leaders go to homes of poor for photo-ops. People will punish them for such insensitivity."
I am sad to hear complaints of rigging & violence in parts of Bengal & UP. EC should ensure such instances don't happen in coming phases.
Didi may abuse me but I am committed to WB's progress. We believe in positive change not politics of revenge http://nm4.in/1kJxZ9YÂ 
"Amazing rally in Asansol. Urged people to elect Babul Supriyo, a youngster devoted to serving people of Bengal pic.twitter.com/nsp6J3Hmso"
Didi talks of real & paper tigers. A real tiger would never have protected those who have looted the poor through chit fund scams.
"Congress, Left & Didi were together in UPA but fight in WB. They are more concerned about infiltrators from Bangladesh than WB's youth."
"Joined rallies in Bankura, Asansol (West Bengal) & Bhadohi & Allahabad (UP) pic.twitter.com/N5AaAAD5aC"
Congress is in ICU. They may get as many of their well-wishers out from jail but it wont add to their fortunes http://nm4.in/Rf1BlcÂ 
I will never forget Patna Rally. Since then I have received lot of affection from Bihar. Will return the affection with record development.
Ganga's condition is worrisome. Contaminated water is a threat to children. We want to change it. Its not about politics but about humanity.
"I shared my ideas for comprehensive development of Poorvanchal, which has been neglected by SP & BSP in Lucknow & by UPA in Delhi."
"Be it UP, Bihar, Uttarakhand or AP, I could see great enthusiasm among people during today's 3D rallies! Thanks to everyone who joined."
Looking forward to addressing Bharat Vijay 3D rallies across the country  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/Â â€¦
NDA will usher in a fresh approach in developing hill states so that people's problems can be understood & addressed more effectively.
Talked about steps NDA will take to improve lives of farmers in the Terai region at the rally in Rudrapur http://nm4.in/1hmuMcHÂ 
Uttarakhand CM forgets that as Union Water Resources Minister he was equally responsible for people's suffering due to floods last year.
CM of Uttarakhand is more concerned about dynastic politics than people's problems. Urged people in Roorkee to reject this dynastic politics

We have witnessed the horrors of Emergency when freedom of press & freedom of expression were suppressed. It is a blot on our democracy.
"On days such as this, I feel very sad to see our National TV channel struggling to maintain its professional freedom."
Greetings to journalist friends on World Press Freedom Day. Free press is a democracy's cornerstone & must be preserved in letter & spirit.

India is one. NDA will not work for Hindus or Muslims but for realising the dreams of the people of India http://nm4.in/1i16uZrÂ 
"PM may have spoken even 1,100 times but did he ever talk about how Sonia ji's NAC,not Planning Commission mattered more in decision making?"
Cong is only bothered about power & the chair. A Mother's love is understandable but not at the cost of the nation & people's aspirations.
If Cong thinks they can survive by repeating false promises they are mistaken. People of India have called Cong's bluff & will punish it.
While I was speaking I could see large number of people gathered at the various locations. I derive lot of strength from their enthusiasm.
Addressed 3D rallies in over 100 places across India. After this round I have addressed 900 3D rallies in the last few weeks.
Hope to see you at the 3D rallies later this evening. Here are the locations once again  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/?lang=EnglishÂ â€¦

People were very happy to know about our endeavour to build smart cities across India & our commitment to make Seemandhra a â€˜Knowledge Hub.â€™
Youngsters from AP working in Gulf are exploited but UPA is not bothered. NDA will take all steps to protect interests of our youngsters.
"Had UPA integrated rivers, Seemandhra's farmers would not have suffered. We will fulfil Atal ji's dream of river linking & help farmers."
"We are witnessing a phenomenal response to NDA rallies. People have seen through Congress, that has always insulted people from this land."
"Venkaiah ji, @ncbn, Pawan Kalyan & myself campaigned across Seemandhra today. Asked people to elect NDA candidates for a Swarna Andhra."

Never imagined such a remarkable response to #SelfieWithModi. A big thanks. Here are some Tweets shared by friends http://nm4.in/1rEihOeÂ 
"I salute the 6 crore people of Gujarat, without whose efforts the state would never have scaled these heights of progress. Congrats to them."
On Gujarat Day we remember the sacrifices & contribution of all those great women & men without whom Gujarat would not have been created.
"On Gujarat Day, sharing this beautiful song by the versatile AR Rahman. Hope you enjoy it http://nm4.in/1jk2406Â "
I pray that both Gujarat & Maharashtra scale new heights of development so that aspirations of the youth are fulfilled.
People of Maharashtra & Gujarat share a very close bond & I hope this bond continues to grow in the years to come.
"Greetings to people of Gujarat & Maharashtra on the foundation day of the 2 states, which started their development journey on 1st May 1960."
A picture from today's Tirupati rally pic.twitter.com/COgROxLtnc
Congrats to people for joining the festival of democracy in large numbers. Its gladdening to see first time voters voting in large numbers.
Congress defeat is certain. NDA is the only Alliance that can provide India a stable Govt. that can deliver progress http://nm4.in/1n2QEhLÂ 
Hearing Pawan Kalyan makes me very happy. Here is a bright youngster who embodies the Telugu Spirit & is committed to serving people.
"Under @ncbn Hyderabad became globally known for Software industry. The same way, NDA is committing to make Seemandhra a Hardware Capital."
NDA will devote special attention to Seemandhra's coastline & focus on ports that will become the gateway to India & Seemandhra's progress.
"From energy to weavers of Seemandhra, this land can give lots to the nation. NDA will harness this potential & develop Seemandhra."
2014 polls are about Seemandhra's future. They have to choose between Seemandhra & Scam Andhra. One wrong choice can impact people's future.
"In Tirupati, urged people of Seemandhra to bless NDA with a resounding majority in the State Assembly & elect all NDA MPs to Lok Sabha."
Later this evening I will address a rally in Tirupati. Looking forward.
I can never forget the affection Bihar has given me & am committed to doing everything possible for Bihar's progress  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/30/ujiyarpur/Â â€¦
"After 10 years of misgovernance & a certain defeat in 2014, Congress now wants instability, which is the last thing India needs today."
Cong got Lalu ji released from jail but top Cong leaders are avoiding sharing stage with him in rallies. People can see through these games.
"Urged people of Bihar to bless NDA, which will fulfil dreams of Shri Karpoori Thakur & bring a change in lives of the poor & marginalised."
Campaigned in Bihar. Here is a picture with Shri Ram Vilas Paswan at the Hajipur rally  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/30/hajipur/Â â€¦ pic.twitter.com/BKHhotBspN

This election is an election of hope & about restoring trust. Am sure 2014 Elections will give new strength to the nation.
I am glad that the people of Gujarat took the campaign in their own hands & worked tirelessly for it. I congratulate them.
"I apologize to people of Gujarat. During the entire campaign, I spent only 18 hours campaigning in the state."
Voted! Here is my selfie pic.twitter.com/7OnhFiJ0AC
Will continue the campaign with rallies in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh http://nm4.in/1fJ7aOJÂ 
"I request all those voting in 119 Assembly seats in Telangana region & in by-polls in Bihar, Gujarat, UP & WB to turnout in large numbers."
Urging all those voting in 89 Lok Sabha seats across India to vote in record numbers today! Hope my young friends show the way in doing so.
On my way to vote. I consider myself extremely blessed & fortunate to be a voter in Advani ji's Parliamentary Constituency.
NDA assures a development oriented Govt. where the people's voice is heard & the people's will is supreme http://nm4.in/QYMRGWÂ 
"India needs a strong Government. Modi does not matter. I can go back & open a tea stall. But, the nation can't suffer anymore."
"India has lost all hope from UPA, which can neither inspire nor fulfil aspirations of the youth. UPA's sole aim is to save their chairs."
There is no question of insulting our martyrs who give everything to the nation. I would rather quit politics than insult our martyrs.
I came to the rally on a very sad note. I was deeply pained on how petty politics took over my tribute to Vikram Batra in HP earlier today.
Thankful to all those who joined the Bharat Vijay 3D rallies. This is the 7th round of the 3D rallies & the enthusiasm is immense.
Will address a round of 3D rallies today. I look forward to interacting with you  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/?lang=EnglishÂ â€¦
"From Jammu to Kanyakumari, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh here are some campaign details you will enjoy reading  http://nm4.in/QXVdi1Â "
"I interacted with friends from print, electronic & regional media. You can read a compilation of my interviews here http://nm4.in/1rAIo91Â "
"By the end of the campaign I would have addressed 1350 3D rallies & joined Chai Pe Charcha, that was held across 4000 locations."
"By the time campaigning ends, I would have addressed 475 mega rallies, including 196 Bharat Vijay Rallies across every part of India."
Many friends are asking me about the nature & extent of the campaign so far. They want to know how many rallies I have addressed so far.
Campaigned in Himachal Pradesh & Uttarakhand. People in these states feel betrayed due to misgovernance both in Centre & in their states.
Gujarat Government has ordered a magistrate level inquiry to look into the cause of the building collapse.
Saddened to hear about the building collapse in Surat. Condolences to families of those who lost their lives & prayers with the injured.
The nation will never forget the sacrifices of Major Mukund Varadarajan & Sepoy Vikram Singh. My condolences to the bereaved families.
Touched to read of this brave act & this gesture of compassion. Makes us feel proud of our personnel in Uniform  http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/i-had-the-honour-of-flying-your-brave-son-moving-letter-to-martyr-s-parents-514970Â â€¦

Another round of 3D rallies this evening. Here are the locations  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/?lang=EnglishÂ â€¦
Nation wants freedom from Cong's habits of dividing people. India is looking to NDA for good governance http://nm4.in/1lZRJphÂ 
"In a bid to hide their anti-Guj bias, Congress leaders come to Guj & spread lies but people are determined to reject anti-Guj UPA & Cong."
Concluded the campaign in Gujarat. Amazing response! Sought blessings of people & urged them to send 26 Lotuses to Delhi.
Our path is the path of good governance & development. Irresponsible statements by the likes of Dr. Abdullah cannot derail India's mission.
"Instead of telling those voting for Modi to drown, Dr. Abdullah should look at himself & his family in the mirror & see how they ruined J&K."
"Due to communal politics of Abdullah family, Kashmiri Pandits were removed from their homes only due to their religion. Is this secularism?"
"Just for the sake of politics, Dr. Abdullah's family communalised J&K, which is a land of Sufism and harmony http://nm4.in/1iuCZ2MÂ "
"Dr. Abdullah, in the history of our glorious culture, if there is someone who has done most harm to secularism it is you and your family."
We are secular not because the word was added in our Constitution. Secularism is in our blood. We believe in Sarva Pantha Sambhava.
Dr. Abdullah's recent statements were hilarious. He showcased his ignorance & tried to hide how his family ruined J&K  http://nm4.in/1iuCZ2MÂ 
"Subhas Babu said, ""Give me blood, I will give you freedom."" I told people, ""Give us support, we will give Surajya""  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/27/srirampur/Â â€¦"
"People of Bengal have understood that Congress, Left & Trinamool are all 1. Their misgovernance has ruined WB. NDA will bring an end to this"
"Successive Govts. ignored jute industry but NDA is firm on reviving the industry, just like we revived the textile sector in Gujarat."
Who is Mr. Chidambaram trying to protect in Sharda Chit Fund Scam? NDA assures total investigation into the scam where people were cheated.
"People from Bihar, Odisha & Marwaris are not welcome for Mamata Didi but those from Bangladesh are. Time to stop such votebank politics."
"Mamata Didi is more concerned about her chair than people. She has to realize that she is in power now, time of Andolans are long over."
I have great respect for her but I wonder where did Mamata Didi's Mamata go? She put water on hopes of people & is doing just what Left did.
Addressed a rally in Srirampur in West Bengal. Here is a picture with Bappi Lahiri & @DrChandanMitra pic.twitter.com/xKgnhXszMp
"People of UP want freedom from SP, BSP & Congress, who have helped each other instead of helping people http://nm4.in/1fl3aZRÂ "
"The way Rahul Baba is making statements with a dash of comedy in them, I think the TV show of Kapil Sharma may soon have to shut shop."
"Rahul Baba says ""27,000 crore posts are vacant"" & ""2 out of 1"" children are malnourished in Guj. Only he can explain how this can happen."
"Bundelkhand is blessed with rivers but there is no water. Farmers are suffering across UP, law & order is poor but UP Govt. is unfazed."
A picture from the rally in Jhansi pic.twitter.com/f7nHb6jNvI
"Fatehpur is next to Rae Bareli. Despite a powerful woman MP, I was saddened to know that these areas lack proper sanitation facilities."
"Congress Ministers from UP are more concerned about appearing on TV, even if it means making illogical statements instead of serving people."
"Today's rallies in Jhansi, Fatehpur, Unnao, Mahoba & Sidhauli were phenomenal. People from all sections of society joined in large numbers."
My condolences to Mulayam Singh Yadav ji & his family on the demise of his elder brother Ratan Singh Yadav ji. May his soul rest in peace.
Will address 5 rallies across UP & 1 rally in West Bengal today  http://nm4.in/1mGKsvPÂ

I want to thank friends on social media for relentlessly puncturing one lie after another spread by Congress & questioning their leaders.
"Congress says a tsunami destroys & Modi talks of tsunami. Yes, this is a Tsunami that will destroy corruption, price rise & misgovernance."
Addressed a round of 3D rallies & then went to Rajkot for a rally. Direction of the wind is clear all across. Cong wont survive the Tsunami.
I hope to see you at the 3D rallies that are being held across India later today  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/?lang=EnglishÂ â€¦
2014 Elections are a movement towards Surajya & NDA stands for development that will create a better India http://nm4.in/1hAdI1KÂ 
"Be it safety of fishermen, better infrastructure, healthcare & drinking water facilities, NDA is committed to development of the UTs."
"From shortage of drinking water & poor healthcare services, lack of development in UTs is sad. Centre never devoted attention to these UTs."
"Told people in Daman & Silvassa that being UTs, I did not have chance to serve them in last decade but I want to serve them now from Delhi."
"Campaigned in UTs Daman, Silvassa & continued the campaign across Gujarat with rallies in Mahuva, Pavi Jetpur & Bharuch."
This round of 3D rallies extensively covers the parts of India where elections are to be held in the remaining phases  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/?lang=EnglishÂ â€¦
"Rallies in Kangra, Mandi, Shimla and Hamirpur  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/index.php?State=Himachal%20Pradesh&lang=EnglishÂ â€¦"
You can join the 3D rallies in any of the following places in UP  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/index.php?State=Uttar%20Pradesh&lang=EnglishÂ â€¦
3D rallies will be held across several places in Andhra Pradesh  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/index.php?State=Andhra%20Pradesh&lang=EnglishÂ â€¦
I look forward to seeing you at the 3D rallies that will be held today. Check the locations here  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/?lang=EnglishÂ â€¦
"NDA will focus on 5T formula (trade, tradition, talent, technology & tourism) which create a developed Amritsar  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/25/amritsar/Â â€¦"
Talked about creating special Yatri Trains that will be specially devoted to bringing devotees to Amritsar. This can help boost tourism.
"With a focus on infrastructure & cleanliness, NDA will make Amritsar a central destination for tourists & devotees from all over the world."
"We welcome Shri Daljeet Singh Kohli, Dr. Manmohan Singh's brother, into BJP. His presence will add to our strength pic.twitter.com/Yh4dvhmFV2"
"In his trademark style, full of depth & wit, Parkash Singh Badal ji spoke on Punjab's development & Cong's dislike towards people of Punjab."
"I have known Jaitley ji since his student days. His intellect, integrity & commitment to progress make him a gem of a person in public life."
An insightful speech was given by @arunjaitley where he highlighted his vision for Amritsar & talked about the nation's unhappiness with UPA
"Urged people of Amritsar to elect @arunjaitley, who will be best person for Amritsar's progress & an effective voice for Amritsar in Delhi."
Will join a rally in Amritsar in support of @arunjaitley http://nm4.in/16RZnOkÂ 
"We are travelling across India, finding solutions to India's problems but Congress is busy finding solutions to Modi http://nm4.in/QL01arÂ "
I want Ludhiana to become the pride of India with a shining manufacturing sector that takes lead in creating a globally known 'Brand India.'
"To take a lead over nations like China we need to focus on manufacturing sector, skill development & ensure that cities like Ludhiana grow."
UPA's failure to protect our borders has ensured easy entry of narcotics & fake currency. This is ruining our youth & must stop immediately.
"Addressed rallies in Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana & Bathinda. Punjab gave me lot of affection. Will return the affection with development of Punjab."
"Will address 4 more rallies across Punjab, including a rally in Amritsar in the evening in support of @arunjaitley ji  http://nm4.in/1sLQwXxÂ "
"We have never seen such a weak& corrupt Govt. like UPA. Punjab should bless NDA, which will give stability & progress  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/25/pathankot/Â â€¦"
Addressed a rally in Pathankot in support of Vinod Khanna ji. Parkash Singh Badal ji talked about Congress' apathy towards Punjab.
"Time & again Gujarat has reposed faith in development. This time too, it will punish anti-development & anti-Guj UPA  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/24/vadodara/Â â€¦"
An institution no less than CAG appreciated Guj's efforts to tackle malnutrition. Sadly Madam wants to play petty politics on serious issues
"From dropout rates, debt to malnutrition in Guj, Madam tried her best to mislead people with incorrect facts. Thankfully, people are wiser."
Fear of defeat is visible on Congress & that is why Cong is spreading lies. Madam came to Gujarat but even in land of Bapu she spread lies.
"Urged people of Bihar to elect NDA, which will ensure justice to farmers & fulfil the dreams of Bihar's youth http://nm4.in/1iimvFOÂ "
"Began the day by filing my papers in Varanasi, addressed rallies in Bihar & then spoke at a rally in Vadodara  http://nm4.in/1nJo7h2Â "
I thank the policemen and security forces who were there during the entire roadshow & nomination process.
I am emotionally touched & moved to see the enthusiasm& hardwork of our Karyakartas. We are very proud of you all.
My coming to Varanasi is like a child going to his Mother. I have come to this divine land on the call of Ganga Mata.
Thank you Varanasi. No words will describe the affection you have showered today. Truly touched pic.twitter.com/IPKGGIUJTH
"As I go to file my papers, sharing a Blog where I have penned a few thoughts about Varanasi & my journey  http://nm4.in/1mBsBX2Â "
My special gratitude to all Karyakartas & well wishers who have been tirelessly working on the ground & supporting me from all over India.
"I thank Party leadership for giving me an opportunity to contest from Varanasi, a confluence of history, culture, tradition & spirituality."
Friends today I will file my nomination papers from Varanasi. I seek your support & blessings as I embark on this journey.
I particularly call upon my young friends to go & vote in large numbers. The youth of India must show the way!
"Urging all those voting across 117 Lok Sabha seats & Assembly by-elections in Bihar, MP & TN to vote in record numbers."
A vote for NDA is a vote for a Govt. that will lay the foundation of a Bhavya & Divya Bharat that we will be proud ofÂ  http://nm4.in/1jN38Y4Â 
'Jod-tod' politics has ruined our nation. Time has come to vote for a stable Govt. that is not dependent on unhealthy politics.Â 
I really look forward to addressing 3D rallies. Technology enables me to connect with so many fellow Indians & exchange ideas with them.
"Addressed a rally in Jamnagar. Earlier, addressed people across India through 3D technology. Thankful to people for joining in large numbers"
Looking forward to addressing the 3D rallies across India. Do join us in this unique experience  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/?lang=EnglishÂ â€¦
Urged people of Guj to give us the opportunity to fulfil Sardar Patel's dreams of creating a strong & developed India  http://nm4.in/1f5qgDFÂ 
"People of Guj have seen development in last decade & once there is NDA Govt. in Delhi, Guj's development will scale even newer heights."
"From arbitrary cotton export ban to refusal to give permission to install gates on Narmada Dam, UPA's anti-Gujarat bias has been evident."
"Campaigning across Gujarat today, I could see anger among people against UPA & their eagerness to reject anti-Gujarat government in Delhi."
Sad to hear of demise of RB Chaudhary (Guj police) who passed away due to heart attack while on duty in Bihar. Condolences to his family.RIP

"Urged people of Telangana to vote for NDA, which is committed to fulfilling aspirations of Telangana & its youth  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/22/nizamabad/Â â€¦"
Several people were martyred for Telangana cause but Cong was unfazed. People should remember these games played by Congress & reject it!
"Compare the way NDA ensured creation of Jharkhand, Uttarakhand & Chhattisgarh with UPA's incompetent handling of Telangana creation."
BJP is proud of its unwavering commitment to creation of Telangana. Manner in which Congress conducted itself is very very unfortunate.
"Be it Rajiv Gandhi insulting former AP CM Anjaiah or Cong humiliating PV Narasimha Rao, Cong has a history of ill-treating leaders from AP."
"Campaigned in Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Mahbubnagar & Hyderabad. @ncbn, Pawan Kalyan & @kishanreddybjp strongly criticised UPA."

I disapprove any such irresponsible statement & appeal to those making them to kindly refrain from doing so.
Petty statements by those claiming to be BJP's well wishers are deviating the campaign from the issues of development & good governance.
"With great happiness, the entire nation is looking towards BJP for going to people solely on the issues of good governance & development."

"Urged my young friends- don't only be a voter, go out & become a canvasser, ask people to vote in large numbers for a strong Govt. in Delhi."
"Due to UPA's misgovernance, India witnessed record joblessness. We can't let things go on this way. We need to create more opportunities."
Our priority is to improve rail infrastructure through technology & professionalism. People of Mumbai will gain immensely from this.
"Great rally in Mumbai. Uddhav ji, Munde ji, Athawale ji & other leaders made a strong appeal for resounding victory of Mahayuti in 48 seats."

"Give us 80 Lotuses from UP so that India gets a strong Govt. Cong, SP & BSP should not open their accounts in UP http://nm4.in/1pmADaQÂ "
"Condition of Yamuna in UP is pitiable. Giving example of our efforts for Sabarmati, shared our commitment to restoring Yamuna's glory."
Talked on need to improve tourist infrastructure in Mathura so that it can draw more tourists & devotees from all over India & the world.
"NDA is committed to revitalising glass, bangle & small scale industries in Firozabad, which have suffered due to apathy of Centre & UP Govt."
"Manner in which Cong, SP & BSP are mocking my poor background shows their mindset. Yes, I am proud I sold tea...I never sold the nation."
SP & BSP devote their energies to trouble each other while in power & Cong provokes them from Delhi. Concern towards people of UP is absent.
"Addressed rallies in Hardoi, Firozabad, Etah & Mathura. UP is all set to reject SP, BSP & Congress  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/21/mathura/Â â€¦"
"Enough of misgovernance & votebank politics. People of India want development & unity, which only NDA can provide  https://www.india272.com/2014/04/20/surguja/Â â€¦"
Urged people of Maharashtra to elect all Mahayuti candidates for a strong Government in Delhi http://nm4.in/1mpJ1EhÂ 
Cong-NCP's lack of concern towards people of Maharashtra is startling. Farmers are suffering in the state but their issues remain unsolved.
Madam tells people of Amethi to take care of her son...How can a Son who cant take care of Amethi take care of the entire nation?
"Due to Congress' sins, people of Chhattisgarh rejected them thrice & reposed faith in BJP & @drramansingh to work for progress of the state."
"Picture from today's Bilaspur rally. Addressed rallies in Durg, Surguja (Chhattisgarh) & Jalgaon (Maharashtra) pic.twitter.com/GYAgXYwevi"

I want to congratulate @smritiirani & Karyakartas of Amethi. Ever since their campaign began Cong is worried if their leader will be elected
There is no place for betrayers in a democracy. Congress is singing the same tune on poverty since time immemorial but nothing has changed.

Lakhs of people sought employment in Assam but only a few thousand received work under NREGA. Is this 'Governance' as per Congress?
"Instead of talking about Gujarat & me, it would be better if Assam CM devotes his attention to Assam. Congress has ruined the state."
Spent the day campaigning in Assam & Bihar. People's determination to punish UPA is becoming stronger day by day! pic.twitter.com/jfwEdAjxdd

"Some are busy building Elephant Parks, some are busy on Lion Safaris & those in Delhi are least bothered. People of UP deserve better."
Netaji is 'Mulayam' where he has to be tough but is tough where he must be 'Mulayam.' This is not good for UP http://nm4.in/1iwcNnMÂ 
Spoke at 2 rallies in UP & 2 in MP. This picture is from the rally in Etawah pic.twitter.com/luz36b5TXk
Youngsters should not see 2014 Polls as a poll to elect a new Govt. These polls are about the future of our youth  http://nm4.in/1j7nDNmÂ 
"Madam says BJP doesn't respect institutions. Who was responsible for Emergency?There is CBI misuse, CBI-IB tension & lot more under UPA."
"Recently Madam addressed the nation by purchasing prime time space on TV, but what she said was full of lies!  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/17/3d-rally/Â â€¦"
I would like to congratulate 1st time voters for turning out in such large numbers. Increased turnout of women voters is commendable.
Large turnout in the phases held till now shows Congress' departure is certain! Focus must now be on electing a stable & strong Govt.

Madam came to Kanyakumari & said UPA works for safety of our fishermen. I asked people if they believed her & the unanimous answer was 'No.'
NDA will take all steps to develop Erode's textile sector. Special focus will be given to strengthen Ayurveda & herbal medicine sector.
A former Congress Minister from TN delayed key development projects. 'Jayanthi Tax' stalled growth & youth lost jobs. Will Cong answer why?
From the rally in Erode earlier today pic.twitter.com/VtXKTEujMw
"Polling for 121 Lok Sabha seats, 77 seats for Odisha Assembly & 2 by-elections in WB underway. Urging voters to vote in record numbers."

NDA promises a revolutionary approach towards development where Centre & States will together take India forward http://nm4.in/P53krXÂ 
It is our commitment to create a vibrant & globally recognised 'Brand India' that is synonymous with quality & enriches lives of our people.
Assured people of Salem that NDA will leave no stone unturned in strengthening our steel sector through value addition & latest technology.
MP rejected Cong's 'Bantadhar Govt.' in 2003. Time for India to do the same & give a historic defeat to Congress http://nm4.in/1eIrCo5Â

"Assured people of Jharkhand that NDA will complete all the projects initiated during Atal ji's time, that are stalled under UPA."
"Coming from a poor family, I never had luxury of having toffees but in last decade Guj has won several trophies for good governance!"
"Shahzada has not got over his childhood days, which is why he can't see beyond balloons & toffees. Development is a non-issue for him."
Congress' situation across India is so bad that we will not need CCTV cameras but high resolution cameras to find their MPs in Parliament.

Congress is least bothered about marginalised sections of society. They must tell people why they humiliated Babasaheb Ambedkar repeatedly.
Political untouchability & disrespect towards institutions is the hallmark of Congress. No wonder it was a Congress PM who imposed Emergency
2nd round of Bharat Vijay Rallies via 3D technology..great response! People across 15 states joined the rallies  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/14/2nd-3d-rally/Â â€¦
Will address Bharat Vijay Rallies across India through 3D technology later today. See your nearest location to join  http://indiancag.org/namo-campaign-trail/3D/?lang=EnglishÂ â€¦
Babasaheb Ambedkar gave us freedom of speech but such is Congress that PM himself lost this right. Who in Cong snatched this right from him?
3 members of 1 family got Bharat Ratna quickly but no Congress Govt. thought of Bharat Ratna for Babasaheb Ambedkar. This speaks volumes
"Unaware of India's history & tradition, Shahzada is continuing Congress' tradition of insulting Babasaheb Ambedkar & the values he stood for"
"Rajasthan created history & uprooted Congress in the state. Same way, people of India are going to reject misrule & corruption of Congress."
"Spoke at a rally in Sikar, Rajasthan  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/14/laxmangarh/Â â€¦"
Have shared my thoughts on Babasaheb Ambedkar & quest for equality & harmony in society in my book 'Samajik Samrasta' http://nm4.in/Q5ApVMÂ 
"Earlier today, paid tributes to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar in Gandhinagar  http://nm4.in/1gufG4iÂ  pic.twitter.com/AR1tGL4l9X"
"Addressed a rally in Lakhimpur Kheri, UP  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/14/lakhimpur-kheri/Â â€¦"
"I pray for a year filled with joy, peace, prosperity & may the harvest festivals bring all the success for our hardworking farmers."
"Greetings to people across India on the auspicious festivals of Baisakhi, Rongali Bihu, Mesadi, Puthandu, Vishu, Pohela Baishakh."
Lets reaffirm our commitment towards Babasaheb Ambedkar's ideals & work tirelessly towards creating an India that will make Babasaheb proud.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's life is journey of unmatched determination & unbreakable commitment to social justice. He inspires every Indian.
Tributes to Yug Purush Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on his birth anniversary. Our great Constitution is the result of his monumental efforts.
NDA has emerged as an alternative in TN & emergence of this strength is in the interests of the people of TN http://nm4.in/1lX8AKeÂ 
Protecting our fishermen & strengthening our fishing industry will be priority for NDA. We have seen how fishermen have suffered under UPA.
UPA's defeat is certain. Their situation is so bad that top ministers don't want to contest polls. See how Recounting Minister ran away!
Need of the hour is to strengthen India's Federal Structure. PM & CMs must work together as a 'Team India' devoted to India's development.
"A vote for NDA is a vote for a new ray of hope in TN, where 2 main parties spend time destroying each other, not solving people's problems."
Thank you Chennai for the enthusiasm during today's Bharat Vijay Rally! There is strong support for NDA in all parts of the nation.

NDA is firm on its commitment to create a corruption free India so that best opportunities are created for our youth http://nm4.in/1gqboOHÂ 
Cong's politics is based on prolonging people's problems & that is why none of their leaders talk of their failure to check rising prices.
"Through better packaging & technical upgradation, we can transform Chikmagalur's coffee industry but such changes are not a priority for UPA"
Talked about NDA's vision to improve lives of farmers. Misgovernance of UPA & Karnataka Govt has caused great despair among farmers.
"Karnataka has several powerful Ministers in Delhi but sadly, they prefer serving the interests of 1 family instead of serving people."
"Spoke at rallies in Chikkaballapur, Chikmagalur & Haveri. A picture from Haveri pic.twitter.com/dTOZzp3Sau"
Greetings on Mahavir Jayanti. The ideals & teachings of Mahavir Swami always inspire us. pic.twitter.com/rC576ZKh3A
"A CRPF Jawan from Guj's Aravalli dist. was among those killed in Chhattisgarh. I salute this martyr, who lost his life defending democracy."
"So far Maoists were targeting security forces. Now they are targeting civilians, even medical staff. There is no end to their sinister acts."
"I have always urged Maoists to leave the bullet, join the mainstream & work towards nation building. Sadly their cowardly acts continue."
We salute the brave Jawans & polling officials martyred in the attacks while they were performing yeoman service in upholding our democracy.
I strongly condemn the cowardly attack on CRPF personnel & polling staff by Maoists in Chhattisgarh. Democracy has no place for such attacks
It was disturbing to know that the injured did not get timely medical attention & authorities showed no concern when mishap took place.
"I spoke to Narayan Patel, the Pradhan of Jayapur village & have assured him of all possible assistance from our side."
Several people were injured in the mishap. A young girl is still lying unconscious in a private hospital. Wish her a speedy recovery.
Got news from our Karyakartas of an unfortunate mishap in Jayapur village near Varanasi where a high tension line fell on 440 volt line.
"Don't forget to watch ""Aap Ki Adalat"" with @RajatSharmaLive on @indiatvnews. The Adalat convenes in a few minutes at 10 PM."
If Cong cant tell truth about their own former CM how can we trust them? The Govt. after 16th May will place everything in front of people.
Congress must come clean on the serious allegations of undeclared foreign bank accounts of their Amritsar candidate & his family members.
"Constitution clearly talks about feeding & educating people. Why is Cong repeatedly insulting Babasaheb Ambedkar by saying ""We gave Acts."""
"Poor say we are hungry,Shahzada says we gave you Acts. People say we want education, he says we gave Acts. What kind of a mean joke is this?"
India will move ahead when institutions are respected. Success lies in how ideas are institutionalized. UPA miserably failed on that count.
In last 10 years we saw such a severe Accident that the entire nation has been ruined! UPA has not maintained sanctity of the office of PM.
"Yesterday I read that a book has come out, written by a close aide of PM & it spills the beans on why things were ruined in last decade."
"Spoke at rallies in Ahmednagar & Pune. Nation has already lost a lot in last decade, We cant lose more time. Vote NDA for developed India."
Dadasaheb Phalke award to Gulzar Sahab is a fitting tribute for his rich contribution to India cinema. My congratulations to him.
Give us over 300 seats & we assure you a strong & stable Govt. that will make India a stronger & developed nation http://nm4.in/1n22TNQÂ 
Shahzada came to Rajasthan without informing their CM & rode on a bike belonging to a history sheeter. Perhaps he was inspired by Dhoom 3.
We will actively harness Barmer's potential in energy & petroleum sector so that lives of youth are transformed & they get opportunities.
"Giving example of our successful effort in Kutch, talked about the priority NDA attaches to fast-paced development of our desert regions."
Campaigned in Rajasthan. Addressed rallies in Barmer & Banswara  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/12/pachpadara/Â â€¦

NDA will end all troubles Chhattisgarh faces from Delhi & give a strong impetus to the state's development journey  http://nm4.in/1i82vdbÂ 
"Don't expect anything from Congress. Democracy is not in their nature.They survive on dynasty politics, thinking people are in their pockets"

Parts of Odisha voted yesterday & direction of the wind is clear. There will be change both in Delhi & Bhubaneswar http://nm4.in/1i7PLDqÂ 
Odisha has a Govt. that neither speaks language of the people nor understands their pain. Their leaders don't even communicate with people.
Development & good governance is our agenda. We want to move ahead & fulfil dreams of our people http://nm4.in/1jyfX9XÂ 
"Bigger the mandate Congress gets, the bigger mess they spread. Rajiv Gandhi's mandate was bigger than any other & see the mess left behind."
"Through solid waste management, waste water treatment & focus on cleanliness, we can transform our cities & make them truly world class."
"Similarly, health sector is a priority for us. Among other changes, we need good hospitals & a proactive movement to eradicate malnutrition."
"Everywhere, people want to educate their children. It is our duty to provide quality education to every single youngster of our nation."
2014 polls are no longer only about a change of Govt. People want freedom from the existing darkness & want to move to good governance.
"3D technology was used in 2012 Guj Polls & it created a record. This time the scale is much bigger. In a way, we are breaking our own record"

India doesn't fear 'magicians' but it fears 'Black Magic' of last decade that has destroyed opportunities for people  http://nm4.in/1jvYTSfÂ 
There is great scope to develop satellite towns around Jamshedpur but State & Central Govt. lack vision to do so & due to this people suffer
"Campaigned in Jamshedpur. With a right Government, this hardworking city can do wonders & contribute further to India's development."
"We have seen misrule of UPA, Left & 'Nakli Poriborton'. Time to support NDA for 'Asli Poriborton' in Bengal & India http://nm4.in/1n6PWPZÂ "
Chit Fund scam robbed the poor off their hard-earned money. Urged people to bless NDA so that we can punish those who cheated the poor.
2Ts- Tea & Tourism drive Darjeeling's progress. NDA will sharpen the focus on the 2Ts so that Darjeeling's development scales newer heights.
A glimpse from the rally in Darjeeling. Urged people to give us 60 months to undo damage of 60 yrs of Congress rule pic.twitter.com/0dv6NGnG67
"All those voting today in 91 Lok Sabha seats, 70 seats for Odisha Vidhan Sabha & by-election in Maharashtra should vote in record numbers."
NDA is committed to fulfilling Atal ji's dream of river linking so that Maharashtra's farmers don't have to suffer http://nm4.in/1qqlNevÂ 
"When a Govt. is immersed in Parivar Bhakti instead of Desh Bhakti, result is a weak Govt. in Delhi due to which every neighbour troubles us."
"From Tandoor Case to recent Latur Case, Congress' 'commitment' to safety & dignity of women is evident. Nothing has changed in so many years"
"Congress leaders specialise in poverty tourism. With cameras, they go to villages, sit with the poor, eat their food & get pictures clicked."
Cong-NCP is not bothered about farmers & traders. When farmers ask for water what do their Ministers reply?  And LBT has ruined traders.
"The overwhelming response at the rallies in Sangli, Solapur & Latur clearly shows people are eager to uproot anti-people Congress-NCP."
On my way to Vadodara to file my nomination papers .

"In Mysore, talked about BJP's commitment to draw tourists from all over the world so that there can be greater opportunities for the poor."
People are asking what happened to the thousands of crores that have been allotted to schemes like NREGA. Why are youngsters still jobless?
"On Aadhaar, neither the Team that I met nor PM could answer my Qs on security threat it can pose. There is no vision, only political gimmick"
Congressâ€™ situation is so bad that they have put a candidate worth thousands of crores in Bengaluru...but he has no Aadhaar!
"NDA brought the IT Act. Software export growth during NDA time was 40%, it has fallen to 9%...and Shahzada says Cong brought IT revolution!"

Congress is like a watermelon- green outside but red from within. Time to reject such a Party across the nation http://nm4.in/1hnMotlÂ 
UPA is more interested in Defence Deals rather than Defence Power & this explains why we are facing so many problems today.
"Cong promised zero tolerance towards terror, upgradation of arms & equipments in it's previous manifestos. Did they do anything about it?"
"Be it killing of Kerala fishermen by Italian marines & suffering of farmers due to Endosulfan, Centre & Kerala Govt's silence is deafening."
"Kerala can give lots to the world, but due to lack of jobs at home, it is exporting its youth in large numbers. This is costing Kerala dear."
"From being a land known for tourism, Kerala has become a nursery of terrorism. Its high time UDF & LDF answer people why this is happening."
Unbelievable enthusiasm at the Kasargod rally! People of Kerala are fed up of friendly match between UDF & LDF. They want freedom from both.
"We salute brave CRPF personnel martyred in Aurangabad, Bihar. We stand by their families in this hour of grief. Prayers with the injured."

"In Rajasthan, urged people to support NDA so that @VasundharaBJP gets a supportive Govt. in Delhi that is committed to Rajasthan's progress."
Narcotics & lot of fake currency is entering through our borders but Centre is watching silently & helplessly. Why? http://nm4.in/1fVrOOMÂ 
Both Haryana & Rajasthan have witnessed the disastrous consequences of 'Damaad Power.' Lands of farmers were taken to enrich one family.
Campaigned in Haryana & Rajasthan. In both states people want to know what happened to promises UPA made but Cong is too arrogant to answer.
Need of the hour is to move a step ahead of Health Insurance & focus on Health Assurance for our citizens.
"Our #BJPManifesto has highlighted our Party's strong commitment to increase access, improve quality & lower costs of health services."
"On World Health Day, we reaffirm our commitment to create a Healthy India where every citizen has access to quality & affordable healthcare."

NDA is committed to providing a strong Govt. where we can walk with our heads held high at the global level & every nation respects us.
We are going to people with Mantra of good governance & development. We assure you a Govt. that thinks & works for the poor. #BJPManifesto
#BJPManifesto- for us manifesto is not a ritual or formality. The Manifesto encapsulates our Disha & Lakshya towards a developed India.
"#BJPManifesto - a futuristic & inclusive manifesto that will take India ahead, creating 'Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat.'"

Friends tomorrow I look forward to connecting with lakhs of people across over 100 places in India through 3D technology!
On 9th I will file my nomination papers for Vadodara Lok Sabha seat. Going to meet Atal ji at his residence to seek his blessings.
NDA wants to change people's lives. We are devoted to ensuring that the poor enjoy a life of progress & dignity  http://nm4.in/1e0ZJr6Â 
Those doing votebank politics prefer to keep society poor. They are not committed to development & service. Such parties must be defeated.
"Why should our farmers not get the right price? Farmers are not begging, they worked hard for it & should get good prices."
UP faces acute power shortage but some places of UP are getting uninterrupted power. Why such preferential treatment by Lucknow?
"Congress, SP & BSP are one. They pretend to fight in Lucknow but in Delhi they are friends. Its like those orchestrated wrestling matches."
Urged people of UP to reject Congress & their â€˜allies' SP & BSP in the 2 rallies I addressed in Bijnor & Aligarh. Enthusiasm was great!
"On Vijay Sankalp Diwas, looking forward to addressing Karyakartas from over 6 lakh polling booths this evening  http://indiancag.org/vsd/Â "
"Today BJP has emerged as a ray of hope for every Indian, who sees BJP as the harbinger of providing strong, stable & inclusive governance."
Congratulations on Vijay Sankalp Diwas. I bow to lakhs of Karyakartas who have selflessly devoted themselves to build BJP over the years.
Appealed to people of Shivpuri to elect a Lotus so that they get a hardworking MP who serves them http://nm4.in/1iaPmMQÂ 
Congress' 1 point programme is to facilitate the Son Rise in Delhi. The Nation is secondaryâ€¦only the Son's career must be safe. Very sad.
"When farmers suffered due to hail storms, it was @ChouhanShivraj who rushed to help them. Congress & its leaders were totally indifferent."
"We are proud of governance of @ChouhanShivraj. He has done more for roads, power & water in MP than any preceding Congress Govt. in 50 yrs."
Why did Union Power Minister cancel a programme to award top performing power companies? Because Gujarat power companies won top awards!
What to say about Congress MP who represents Shivpuri...less one says the better. His arrogance is sky high. Perhaps its Congress culture.
No visit to Shivpuri is complete without remembering Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia. She made a place in people's hearts. No one can forget her.
Campaigned in Shivpuri.Saw great enthusiasm. Brought back memories of warm response we got in Shivpuri during Ekta Yatra led by Dr. MM Joshi
India will develop only when Northeast develops! Sharing my recent speeches in the Northeast http://nm4.in/1hqRcYQÂ 
BJP is committed to continuing the good work for development of Northeast that was started by Atal ji  http://www.bjp.org/en/media-resources/press-releases/press-smt-nirmala-sitharaman-on-north-east-statesÂ â€¦
"Just as the first rays of the Sun fall on Northeast, I am confident that the first rays of Mission 272's success will emerge from Northeast."
"As campaigning ends for 1st phase, I call upon my sisters & brothers of Northeast to bless BJP for comprehensive development of the region."
I urge my fellow countrymen & women to strengthen our Democracy by ensuring record participation in the Lok Sabha Elections.
"In 2 days, biggest festival of India's democracy, 2014 Lok Sabha Polls begin. I congratulate EC for their efforts & wish them the very best."
"Will join Advani ji at Karyakarta Sammelan in Gandhinagar. Later, will accompany Advani ji to file his nomination papers."
"@vijayvaani yes for the past rallies you can find photos, speech videos & highlights. You can also share your inputs for forthcoming rallies"
"NDA will ensure Odisha's progress. We will harness Odisha's rich potential in sectors like tourism, handicrafts  http://nm4.in/1dTqMofÂ "

No NDA state figures in list of top 10 states with high crime rate against women while 7 Congress ruled states figure in the list.
"Congress is sharply divided on how to tackle Maoist problem. Sadly, due to their divisions the people of India are suffering."

Places like Kurukshetra have the potential to draw tourists from all over India but neither Centre nor Haryana Govt. have worked on this.
"If there is an improvement in anyone's life, its in lives of Congress leaders & their families. Common people have suffered in last decade."
Shahzada should tell us who are the magicians who took land of farmers & became rich overnight. How is he related to such people?
India's coal resources should help the people but sadly it has filled the pockets of Congress leaders. Can you trust those who steal coal?
For rich Congress leaders politics is a hobby but for us its a medium to serve society. Cong's misgovernance shows their 'concern' for poor.
"At rallies in Kurukshetra & Gurgaon, urged people of Haryana to reject Congress in all 10 seats. Cong shouldn't open its account in Haryana."
India needs to break free from Cong's divisive mindset & take every section of society together for India's progress http://nm4.in/1mCOp44Â 
"For us, secularism is to unite & work for the nation. For Congress, secularism is 'Religion First' but for us it is 'India First.'"
Congress President's recent appeal on religious lines is shocking! Such divisive politics is against laws of our land. EC must take action.
"Now that people have seen through Congress' empty slogans & 'commitment' towards secularism, they have turned to open communalism."
Congress is worried. For years they kept misleading the poor but now a tea seller from a poor family is questioning them on their misdeeds.

Atal ji's dream of linking rivers is our dream as well. This can strengthen the efforts of our hardworking farmers http://nm4.in/1jAgFnMÂ 
We invited farmers from all over India for Agri Summit but Bihar Govt. didn't send farmers. Such petty politics & arrogance is unhealthy.
Talked about strengthening rural infrastructure. Villages need same facilities as our cities. India will progress if our villages progress.
Saw immense enthusiasm at the rally in Buxar. Assured people that NDA will create an India that will make our freedom fighters very proud.

"For us, Nation comes above everything else. We will give our lives for people. Bless NDA for India's growth http://nm4.in/OaT94EÂ "
In MP I don't need to talk about development agenda of BJP. They are already seeing the great work of MP Govt. under @ChouhanShivraj.
"Value addition can help farmers of MP & even other states who produce green peas, but for Congress Mutton & not 'Mutter' is important."
"Congress Manifesto is not a 'Ghoshana Patra' but a 'Dhokha Patra.' Their promises on Nirbhaya Fund, Rural Courts & jobs are unfulfilled."
Addressed rallies in MP. Need of the hour is to uproot Congress. What has happened in last decade cannot be allowed to continue any more.
"2014 is not about BJP or Modi. Its about giving India a strong, stable & inclusive Govt, which only NDA can provide  http://www.india272.com/2014/04/01/bareily/Â â€¦"
"Congress, SP & BSP know they wont win so they are spreading bogey of instability. Instability is the last thing India needs at the moment."
Congress said we will crush Modi...then they said BJP wont get allies. Picture from Kashmir to Kanyakumari suggests otherwise!
For Congress all 365 days are April Fools' Day. They mislead people & remember poor only before elections. Such a Party must be punished.
"India needs a Govt. that works among people & makes schemes for welfare of people, not sitting in AC rooms in Delhi like UPA."

2014 polls are not about arithmetic but people's chemistry with BJP. In arithmetic 1+1 is 2 but such is our chemistry that 1 & 1 becomes 11!
Assam Congress leaders have all the time to go to Delhi but they have no time to wipe tears of people in their own state. Very sad.
Italian marines mercilessly killed our fishermen. If Madam is so 'patriotic' can she tell us in which jail are the marines lodged in?
UPA Chairperson giving us lectures on patriotism is surprising. Do we have to learn patriotism from her? We don't need certificates from her
"Scope of tourism in Arunachal Pradesh is plenty! Sadly, UPA has not focussed on the salient aspects of the Northeast http://nm4.in/1kgdT5AÂ "
A loud & clear NOâ€¦this was the answer I got when I asked whether youngsters in Northeast got jobs & whether prices reduced in last decade.

NDA will provide an agriculture friendly & farmer friendly government that will address every concern of our farmers http://nm4.in/1nGAMVFÂ 
"If agriculture sector shines, the purchasing power in our villages will increase & this will further India's economic growth."
"Farmers, especially small farmers going to Sahukars is worrying. We must ensure availability of proper financial resources for our farmers."
Urged farmers to think beyond length & breadth of their farms. Proper testing of soil health must be done so that productivity increases.
Told farmers that committing suicide is no solution. Assured them that together we will improve things & make our agriculture sector shine.
During the Charcha I interacted with youngsters & women whose relatives committed suicide. It was very saddening to hear their experiences.

"Shastri ji gave the slogan of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' but under UPA neither the Jawan is safe nor are the interests of the Kisan guarded."
"Be it better technology, irrigation & creating a network of goods trains to transport farm products, steps will be taken for farmer welfare."
Assured that NDA Govt. will not allow farmers to die & will ensure they are not dependent on Sahukars for loans at high interest rates.
PM & Agriculture Minister must answer why was cotton export unilaterally banned even when the harvest was good. Ban was put to help whom?

Talked about the importance of value addition & productivity in agriculture. Also urged farmers to focus on planting maximum trees.
Spent the morning with farmers from all across Saurashtra during the ground breaking ceremony of SAUNI Yojana in Rajkot.
The only solace one gets from the vote-on-account is that this was UPA's final act of misery after a decade of decay & policy paralysis.
It is upto the people to decide whether the Economist PM & FM have been 'hard working' or 'hardly working' in their tenure.
'Hard working' Finance Minister also joins other illustrious UPA ministers who are seeking refuge in history to judge their 'performance.'
"I welcome the decision on 'One Rank, One Pension' for our servicemen. Belated wisdom finally dawns on our 'hard working' UPA ministers."
"FM eats up plan exp, rolls over Rs 35,000 cr subsidies to next yr to contain fiscal deficit even as non-plan exp overshoots! Real hard work!"
Mere lip-service by the FM on the return of black money; UPA's lack of commitment towards bringing black money was on display yet again!
"â€œManufacturing is the Achilles' heel, deceleration in investment in manufacturing worryingâ€â€¦this is result of 'wonders' of UPA's policies."
"While the FM may pat his own back, the fact remains that our youth is bearing the brunt of rising unemployment http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pace-of-job-creation-in-india-was-slowest-in-a-decade-a-meagre-2-2/article1-1184462.aspxÂ â€¦"
FM says 296 projects worth Rs. 6.6 lakh crore cleared recently. Why were these projects held back at all? Is it not policy paralysis?
UPA's last vote-on-account is extremely disappointing! It is nothing but a glorified exercise in self-congratulation.
"Parasram Maderna ji was a stalwart of Rajasthan politics, who spent decades in public life.Saddened by his demise.May his soul rest in peace"

PM says money doesn't grow on trees but HP CM's assets grew 14 times in 3 years  & he says it was due to apple trees! Can we trust Congress?
UPA & Himachal Pradesh Govt are not bothered about people of the state. Apple farmers aren't getting good rates & youngsters don't have jobs
Himachal Pradesh needs strong rail connectivity. This will help the common people & will enhance tourism in the state  http://www.india272.com/2014/02/16/narendra-modi-hp-nda-national-development-alliance/Â â€¦
"Problems of every region can't be solved in NDC meetings only. The Centre must go to the states, sit with CMs & work out an action plan."
"From Himalayan states to desert & coastal states, each region has their own challenges. Solutions for one region can't be applied to another"
BJP is committed towards all-round development of Himalayan states. Promised that what didn't happen in 60 years will happen in 60 months!
Himachal will always have a special place in my life. Was doing organisational work for the Party there when I was asked to be Gujarat CM.

"Chai Pe Charcha took me down the memory lane,when I sold tea. It reminded me of my experiences & interactions with different types of people"
"Questions ranged from return of black money, importance of clean energy, poverty alleviation to importance of railways for India's progress."
"People from diverse locations ranging from Varanasi, Patna, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Gurgaon asked questions on good governance."
It was a delight to answer questions from people across the length & breadth of India over a cup of tea during Chai Pe Charcha!
At #ChaiPeCharcha! Great atmosphere. JoinÂ  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-py59EUPpSEÂ â€¦

Kerala is called 'God's Own Country' but why are youngsters leaving in search of jobs? Centre & State Govts have failed to create jobs.
Communists do not believe in democracy. They know people of India will never accept them so they keep taking about Third Front before polls.
UDF & LDF are experts at shadow boxing. It is like WWF on TV. Both of them are not bothered about the development of Kerala.

Tea from Assam energises millions across the nation everyday but Assam's energy situation is poor. Congress is responsible for power crisis.
"Continuous violence & bloodshed, poor law & order situation & lack of jobs for youth are examples of the poor governance in Assam."
Asked people why is there so much poverty in a rich land like Assam. Urged them to reject those who made Assam poor by their misgovernance.

India will progress only if Northeast progresses. We are committed to overall development of Northeast & its bright youngsters.
"From drug trafficking, corruption to fake encounters, Congress has ignored the development in Manipur despite being in power for years."
People of Northeast have a good command over English language & Technology. I see no reason why Northeast cannot become the next IT hub!
Horticulture & agro-based industries need a facelift. Rich minerals can be harnessed. Our Northeast can become a tourist paradise.
Northeast is a blessed land! Imagine the development if we can encourage herbal exports. This can help the youth of the Northeast.
"Lack of governance & lack of attention to Northeast led to the region falling into hands of divisive forces, who do not believe in progress."
"For years, successive Central governments ignored Northeast. It was Atal ji who created a separate Ministry for development of this region."

"Congress says something & does something. In Delhi their leader talks against corruption, in Mumbai they save those involved in Adarsh scam."
Governance in Maharashtra is at an all time low. Irrigation projects are covered with corruption & farmers are committing suicide.
"BJP believes in politics of development. People's welfare is not possible without development. For us, every poor person of India is a VIP."
Congress is immersed in corruption &  votebank politics. They have learnt the 'art' of divide & rule from the colonial rulers rather well.
"It was Mumbai that gave the call of 'Quit India' to the British. Today, urged people to give a clarion call for a Congress Mukt Bharat!"
Thank you Mumbai for the overwhelming support at Maha Garjana Rally.Thanks to friends who joined through social media http://nm4.in/1hvTPvsÂ

People of India are eager to uproot the Congress. The poor want to uproot those who have exploited them for years  http://nm4.in/JOS8hkÂ 
"When elections come Congress chants 'poor poor' but forgets that if someone is responsible for India's poverty, it is Congress & 1 family."
Many see UP as a political playground but this is an insult to UP. We see UP as a land whose development is key to India's development.
People want answers from those who misled the nation in the name of Ganga. Those who cannot care for the Ganga cannot care for the nation!
"Condition of Ganga is pitiable. For others, Ganga may be a river but for us Ganga is our Mother. Ganga is an integral part of our culture."

Welcoming my Party colleague Shri Arun Jaitley to Twitter! @arunjaitley
Urged PM to seek wider consultation with the states & various stakeholders of the Bill before proceeding any further on a Bill like this.
"If implemented, Communal Violence Bill would fragment society & increase violence. It will have results opposite of the stated objective."
"If a Legislation has to be implemented by the States, should it not be legislated by the States? http://nm4.in/19ifamdÂ "
Communal Violence Bill is in clear violation of India's federal structure. Centre is busy forming laws on matters that are in the State List
Timing of Communal Violence Bill is suspicious. Political considerations & votebank politics rather than genuine concerns are guiding it.
"Communal Violence Bill is ill-conceived, poorly drafted & a recipe for disaster! My letter to PM opposing this Bill  http://nm4.in/19ifamdÂ "

Met a delegation from Italy led by the Italian Ambassador to India  http://nm4.in/IfFsPjÂ 
Let us assure families of the victims that sacrifice of their near ones will not go in vain. Time to work towards a stronger & safer India.
Centre's failure to bring the real perpetrators of 26/11 to justice is disappointing. It is high time Centre acts decisively.
26/11 is a grim reminder of the security threat India faces. Best tribute to the victims is to ensure that such attacks never happen again.
"Due to 26/11 attacks we lost our heroes who put duty before self, who sacrificed themselves for the nation. Salute to them!"

Centre is moving slowly on skill development. Their skill lies in forming committees on the issue rather than focussing on the issue itself.
A 'Gyaani' UPA Minister says prices are rising because poor are now eating 2 sabzis. Is this what they think of the poor? Why such mockery!
"Asked people to remember Congress rule in MP- there was no electricity, agriculture was not growing. This has changed under Shivraj ji."

MP Government has given the poor both strength & opportunity. I congratulate @ChouhanShivraj & his team for this http://nm4.in/1jpmam4Â

"Wherever BJP has formed Governments, we have worked for tribal communities. I congratulate @ChouhanShivraj for his work in this field."
Congress makes grand promises in poll bound states but why can't they implement the same promises in states they govern? Why mislead people?
Congress keeps mocking the poor. For us poor are manifestation of God. A person may be born poor but we must work to ensure no one dies poor
These elections are between development agenda & votebank politics. People are angry with Congress & want to punish it.

Did the Home Minister push the note on NCTC in a hurry because he did not want to be on the wrong side of a Cabinet Colleague?
Did the proposal of NCTC get cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Security before it was tabled at the CMs Conference on Internal Security ?
Is it correct that Home Minister changed the proposal of putting NCTC inside IB without even taking intelligence agencies into confidence?
Is it true that the IB had been assured in Dec 2012 by PMO & the Home Minister that NCTC would be within IB?

"PM ji, don't try to mislead the nation by bringing Atalji's name. He did not even allow it to be raised in Agra in 2001 http://nm4.in/SaAc3fÂ "
Earlier also I expressed my concern on Sir Creek during a CM's conference in April 2012. It was in my speech too but PM remained silent.
PM has failed to answer my questions on Sir Creek. He should assure the nation that he has taken no decision to give Sir Creek to Pakistan.
"I request PM not to make any decision on giving away of Sir Creek on 15th Dec. On Sardar Patel's Punya Teethi, he should not commit this sin"
Handing over Sir Creek to Pakistan will be a sell-out of Indian interests & major threat to our safety. Wrote to PM  http://nm4.in/SaAc3fÂ 
The first CM of Uttarakhand Shri Nityanand Swami will be remembered for his lifelong service to society. May his soul rest in peace.

Congress leaders are not only experts at spreading lies but also contradict each other. Can we trust such people?
